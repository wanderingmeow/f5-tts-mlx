# F5 TTS — MLX

Implementation of [F5-TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06885), with the [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) framework.

F5 TTS is a non-autoregressive, zero-shot text-to-speech system using a flow-matching mel spectrogram generator with a diffusion transformer (DiT).

You can listen to a [sample here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lucasnewman.datasets/f5tts/sample.wav) that was generated in ~11 seconds on an M3 Max MacBook Pro.

F5 is an evolution of [E2 TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18009v2) and improves performance with ConvNeXT v2 blocks for the learned text alignment. This repository is based on the original Pytorch implementation available [here](https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS).

## Installation

```bash
pip install f5-tts-mlx
```

## Usage

```bash
python -m f5_tts_mlx.generate --text "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."
```

If you want to use your own reference audio sample, make sure it's a mono, 24kHz wav file of around 5-10 seconds:

```bash
python -m f5_tts_mlx.generate \
--text "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."
--ref-audio /path/to/audio.wav
--ref-text "This is the caption for the reference audio."
```

You can convert an audio file to the correct format with ffmpeg like this:

```bash
ffmpeg -i /path/to/audio.wav -ac 1 -ar 24000 -sample_fmt s16 -t 10 /path/to/output_audio.wav
```

See [examples/generate.py](./examples) for more options.

You can load a pretrained model from Python like this:

```python
from f5_tts_mlx import F5TTS

f5tts = F5TTS.from_pretrained("lucasnewman/f5-tts-mlx")

audio = f5tts.sample(...)
```

Pretrained model weights are also available [on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/lucasnewman/f5-tts-mlx).
